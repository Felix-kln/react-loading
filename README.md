#React playground
In this repo I played with the user waiting for a response of the website

For that during the fetch time placeholder content is displayed to not make him look at a blank website

##Start
To start the project use
###npm start

To experience the loading of placeholder enable a throtteling (fast 3G for example)
after that you should be able to see "content" showing before the data ist fetched from the api
